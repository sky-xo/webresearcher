**Market Context:**
- Bitcoin has struggled to break decisively above the psychologically important $90,000 mark, with traders citing cooling demand from institutional vehicles and cautious positioning ahead of the year-end holiday period.
- Bitcoin has pushed back above $90,000, reclaiming a psychologically important level after a sharp sell-off earlier this month. Price is up nearly 2% on the day, but the broader structure still reflects caution rather than confirmation.
- Resistance is at $93,000 to $94,000, and support is at around $85,000.
