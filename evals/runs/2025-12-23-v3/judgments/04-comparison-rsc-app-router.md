# Judgment: Query 4

**Query:** React Server Components vs Next.js App Router - what's the difference?
**Type:** comparison

## Scores

| Tool | Score | Latency | Reasoning |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| wr-medium | 5/5 | 22s | Excellent mental model ("engine vs car"), comprehensive breakdown of differences, addresses common misconceptions, and provides clear practical implications. |
| wr-low | 5/5 | 17s | Strong explanation with same mental model, covers all key points with good structure. Slightly more concise than wr-medium but equally clear. |
| WebSearch | 2/5 | 2.5s | Superficial coverage, minimal detail, and contains a questionable claim ("only one way to start using RSC is Next.js 13.4+"). Lacks depth for understanding the relationship. |

## Final Call

**Winner:** wr-low
**Reasoning:** This conceptual "how-it-works" comparison query benefits greatly from depth and clarity. wr-low delivers the same quality as wr-medium but 5s faster (17s vs 22s), making it the sweet spot. WebSearch's 2.5s response lacks the conceptual clarity needed to truly understand the relationship, making the 7x latency cost worthwhile for this query type.
