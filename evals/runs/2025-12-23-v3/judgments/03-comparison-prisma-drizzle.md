# Judgment: Query 3

**Query:** Compare Prisma vs Drizzle ORM for a new TypeScript project
**Type:** comparison

## Scores

| Tool | Score | Latency | Reasoning |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| wr-medium | 5/5 | 20s | Comprehensive comparison table, clear use cases, decision guide, and follow-up questions. Very actionable and thorough. |
| wr-low | 5/5 | 21s | Equally comprehensive with detailed table, practical tradeoffs, and sources cited. Slightly different angle (mentions edge environments) but same quality. |
| WebSearch | 3/5 | 3.0s | Covers the basics (philosophy, type safety, performance) but lacks depth and actionable guidance. Missing the nuanced use-case analysis. |

## Final Call

**Winner:** wr-medium / wr-low
**Reasoning:** For comparison queries requiring nuanced decision-making, webresearcher's 20-21s investment delivers significantly more value than WebSearch's 3s response. The comprehensive tables, use-case analysis, and decision frameworks make the difference between "I understand the basics" and "I can make an informed choice." The 6-7x latency cost is justified for this query type.
