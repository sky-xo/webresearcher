# Judgment: Query 7

**Query:** Best practices for error handling in TypeScript APIs
**Type:** best-practices

## Scores

| Tool | Score | Latency | Reasoning |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| wr-medium | 5/5 | 27s | Comprehensive 14-point guide with code examples, HTTP status code mappings, middleware patterns, and API-specific considerations. Immediately actionable. |
| wr-low | 5/5 | 21s | Equally thorough 12-point guide with same depth, includes code examples and clear separation of concerns. Well-organized and practical. |
| WebSearch | 2/5 | 3.0s | Generic bullet-point list lacking context, examples, or API-specific guidance. Mentions tools like Sentry but no implementation details. |

## Final Call

**Winner:** wr-low
**Reasoning:** Best-practices queries require actionable, detailed guidance with examples. wr-low delivers this in 21s vs wr-medium's 27s, making it the optimal choice. WebSearch's 3s response is too generic and lacks the practical depth needed to implement proper error handling in production APIs. The 7x latency cost for webresearcher is justified for this query type.
