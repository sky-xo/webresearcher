# Judgment: Query 8

**Query:** How should I structure a monorepo in 2025?
**Type:** best-practices

## Scores

| Tool | Score | Latency | Reasoning |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| wr-medium | 5/5 | 28s | Comprehensive 8-point guide with clear structure, dependency direction, tooling choices, and practical examples. Includes concrete folder tree and enforcement strategies. |
| wr-low | 5/5 | 27s | Equally thorough with detailed tool comparisons (Nx vs Turborepo), cited sources, and practical guidance. Slightly more tool-specific advice which is valuable. |
| WebSearch | 2/5 | 3.0s | Generic high-level overview with basic folder structure but lacks depth on boundaries, caching, tooling differences, or enforcement strategies. |

## Final Call

**Winner:** wr-low
**Reasoning:** Both webresearcher responses are excellent, but wr-low edges ahead with tool-specific citations and comparisons between Nx/Turborepo while matching wr-medium's latency (27s vs 28s). WebSearch's 3s response lacks the architectural depth and practical implementation details needed for actually structuring a production monorepo. The 9x latency cost is justified for this complex best-practices query.
