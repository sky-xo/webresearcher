# Judgment: Query 10

**Query:** What terminals are AI developers preferring currently?
**Type:** trend

## Scores

| Tool | Score | Latency | Reasoning |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| wr-medium | 5/5 | 50s | Excellent breakdown of terminal emulators by category (AI-native, power-user, cross-platform), with specific citations and survey data. Clear context on Warp, VS Code, iTerm2, and performance-focused options. |
| wr-low | 5/5 | 42s | Equally comprehensive with good categorization and practical recommendations. Includes date context (late 2025) and tailored picks based on workflow. 8s faster than wr-medium. |
| WebSearch | 2/5 | 3.0s | Confuses terminal emulators with AI coding agents (Claude Code is not a terminal). Mentions Warp correctly but lacks depth on actual terminal preferences and workflows. |

## Final Call

**Winner:** wr-low
**Reasoning:** wr-low delivers the same comprehensive trend analysis as wr-medium but 8s faster (42s vs 50s). WebSearch's 3s response contains a fundamental confusion (mixing AI agents with terminal emulators), making it unreliable for this trend query. The 14x latency cost for webresearcher is justified when accuracy and depth matter for understanding current tool preferences.
