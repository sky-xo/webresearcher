## Response B (WebSearch)

Bitcoin is trading around $88,820, with today's range between $87,626 and $89,538.

**Recent Price Action:**

- Bitcoin surged sharply today, briefly touching the $90,000 level before pulling back. Bitcoin climbed from around $87,700 to a high near $90,500 within hours.

**Market Context:**
- Bitcoin has struggled to break decisively above the psychologically important $90,000 mark, with traders citing cooling demand from institutional vehicles and cautious positioning ahead of the year-end holiday period.
- Bitcoin has pushed back above $90,000, reclaiming a psychologically important level after a sharp sell-off earlier this month. Price is up nearly 2% on the day, but the broader structure still reflects caution rather than confirmation.
- Resistance is at $93,000 to $94,000, and support is at around $85,000.

Please note that cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile and change rapidly, so the exact price may differ from these figures by the time you read this.

## Judgment

**Winner:** A (webresearcher)
**Reasoning:** Response A directly answers the question with a specific, current price point ($88,475) along with the recent change (-$587 / -0.66%), which is exactly what was asked. Response B provides a similar price ($88,820) but adds extensive market context that wasn't requested, making it less focused.
