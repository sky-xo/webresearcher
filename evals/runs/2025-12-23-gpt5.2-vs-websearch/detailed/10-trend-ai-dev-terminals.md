# Query 10: What terminals are AI developers preferring currently?

**Type:** trend

## Response A (WebSearch)

### Leading Terminal AI Agents

1. **Claude Code** (Anthropic) - "Right now, Claude Code is in a league of its own."
2. **Warp** - holds top spot on Terminal-Bench, "agentic development environment"
3. **Gemini CLI** (Google) - free and open source
4. **OpenCode** - open-source alternative to Claude Code

### Industry Shift to Terminal
Since February, Anthropic, DeepMind, and OpenAI have all released command-line coding tools.

### Traditional Terminal Productivity Tools
Oh My Zsh, Starship, tmux, fzf, exa, ripgrep, Bat, HTTPie.

## Response B (webresearcher)

Terminal preferences among AI developers are similar to broader dev world, with tilt toward:
- Terminals that stay inside editor/IDE
- AI help for command generation

## What's most preferred (Dec 2025)

### 1) Editor/IDE embedded terminals (most common)
- **VS Code integrated terminal** - ranked ahead of iTerm2 in surveys
- **JetBrains IDE terminal** - investing heavily, adding AI-assisted commands

### 2) Warp (AI-first standalone terminal)
Most prominent "modern terminal with built-in AI" choice.

### 3) OS-default "serious" terminals
- **macOS:** iTerm2 (classic power-user default)
- **Windows:** Windows Terminal (especially with WSL2)
- **Linux:** GNOME Terminal / Konsole

### 4) Performance / power-user terminals
- **WezTerm** (GPU-accelerated, cross-platform)
- **Alacritty / Kitty** (fast terminal + customization)

## Quick recommendation
- Live in VS Code → use VS Code terminal
- Want AI inside terminal → Warp or JetBrains
- Want stability → iTerm2 (macOS), Windows Terminal (Windows)

## Judgment

**Winner:** B (webresearcher)
**Reasoning:** Response B correctly addresses the question about terminal *applications* that AI developers prefer. Response A misinterprets the question and lists AI coding assistants/agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) rather than terminal emulators. Response B demonstrates better understanding of what developers use day-to-day.
