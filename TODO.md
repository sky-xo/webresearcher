# TODO

## Completed
- [x] `--install-skill` flag to copy skill to `~/.claude/skills/webresearcher/`
- [x] Create SKILL.md with usage guidelines
- [x] First eval run: webresearcher vs WebSearch (13-1 win)

## Next Up
- [ ] Add `--verbose` flag to output token usage/cost data
- [ ] Re-run factual queries with `--effort low` to compare
- [ ] Push to GitHub as `sky-xo/webresearcher`

## Someday/Maybe
- [ ] `--verbosity` flag (low/medium/high) - currently self-calibrates well, may not be needed
- [ ] Automate eval runner (currently manual)
