# TODO

## Completed
- [x] `--install-skill` flag to copy skill to `~/.claude/skills/webresearcher/`
- [x] Create SKILL.md with usage guidelines

## Next Up
- [ ] Benchmark webresearcher vs built-in WebSearch across query types

## Someday/Maybe
- [ ] `--verbosity` flag (low/medium/high) - currently self-calibrates well, may not be needed
